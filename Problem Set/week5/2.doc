of course, I use Kruskal's algorithm

and 9 edges I consider.

c.
For a graph G=(V, E), the least number of edges considered by Kruskal's Algorithm is V-1;
the most number of edges are all E.The worst case would be when we had to consider all E edges. 
If we added a vertex 8 to the graph, and connected it to vertex 5 with edge cost 11 (or any cost larger than all the other edge costs in the graph).
(if (5,8) is before (2,5) in the list and after including (5,8) all nodes are included. so must greater than 10)
